### Online Artifacts

Primary online artifacts are captured using the Internet Archive
(Save Page Now) to ensure public, timestamped preservation.

Local copies are created only when:

- material is rare or irreplaceable, or
- archival loss would be unacceptable.

This keeps the archive lightweight, verifiable, and durable.
