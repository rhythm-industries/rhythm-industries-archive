## Known Markings

- **"RHYTHM INDUSTRIES, INC."**
- **"BATAVIA, OHIO U.S.A."**
- **"A1072"** (printed on dial, lower right)

## Notes on Marking “A1072”

The marking **A1072** is present on the printed dial.  
Its exact significance is **unknown**.

It may represent one of the following:

- Dial artwork or print run identifier  
- Label supplier or external vendor part number  
- Internal reference or assembly code  

There is no evidence that **A1072** corresponds to a sellable or customer-facing product part number.

This ambiguity is preserved intentionally.

## Construction

Observed construction suggests assembly from multiple stocked components:

- Injection-molded plastic housing
- Printed dial / label
- Liquid-filled glass thermometer tube (likely alcohol-based, not confirmed)

---

## Calibration

Calibration was likely performed during assembly.

A visible reference mark on the thermometer tube suggests manual alignment, possibly set around **70°F**, a common ambient calibration point for liquid-in-glass thermometers.

This reflects standard workshop calibration practices rather than automated factory calibration.

## Temperature Range (Observed)

- **Fahrenheit:** approximately –20°F to 120°F  
- **Celsius:** approximately –30°C to 50°C

Ranges derived from printed dial markings.  
No supporting catalog or datasheet has been located to confirm official specifications.

## Assembly Context (Inferred)

This item appears consistent with Rhythm Industries’ small-shop manufacturing practices:

- Components sourced or produced separately
- Final assembly and calibration performed in-house
- Functional, utilitarian design with minimal branding
- Documentation likely maintained internally rather than exposed on the product

---

## Condition

- Appears intact and functional
- No visible damage to housing or tube
- Liquid column continuous at time of observation

---

## Provenance

Acquired via family connection.  
Exact production date and original customer use are unknown.

---

## Archival Notes

This record prioritizes **accuracy over completeness**.

Where uncertainty exists, it is explicitly documented rather than resolved through assumption.  
Future discoveries (catalogs, invoices, oral history) may refine or update this record.
