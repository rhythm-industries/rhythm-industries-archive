# Catalog

This catalog records **known Rhythm Industries part models**.

Inclusion here does **not** imply:
- current ownership
- availability
- production quantity
- sale intent

It asserts only that the model **exists or existed**.

As with many mid-20th-century industrial manufacturers, printed markings do not necessarily correspond 1:1 with internal part numbers or catalog identities.
