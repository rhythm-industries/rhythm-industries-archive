# Origin

Rhythm Industries was my father’s work.

It was a small machine shop in Batavia, Ohio.
Inside, metal was cut, bent, welded, and formed by craftsmen.
Bimetallic thermometers, site indicators, and quiet industrial instruments were manufactured.
The beauty is in their utility. Precision creates trust.

There was a lathe that could not accept long stock. The wall was in the way. So the wall was opened. Material fed from outside. The machine and the world were brought into agreement.

The building changed owners. The work had changed. A swing hung from the truss above what was once my father’s office once was. Children had played there again. The place had not forgotten.

Time dispersed most of what was made. Photographs vanished. Drawings were lost. Instruments traveled far from their origin. One thermometer remains with me. Others surface occasionally, like messages carried by water.

What remains most clearly is a way of knowing.

I became a programmer because I grew up around machines. Software is lighter than steel, but it yields to the same principles: constraint, precision, humility before reality, and responsibility for outcome. The medium changed. The rhythm did not.

This archive exists to hold that rhythm.
