QUIET STEWARDSHIP (Fleet Mgmt ⇄ RIA)

THE THING: object-in-world (VIN/serial/markings/material/condition)
   |
   v
CANON: simple durable record (1 page/log; boring formats; append-only)

TRUTH STACK:
  [FACTS] observed
  [UNKNOWN] honest gaps
  [NOTES] interpretation (labeled)
  [EVIDENCE] linked + attributed (orbits, never replaces)

IDENTITY SHAPES (DO NOT COLLAPSE):
  COLLECTION = why together
  ASSET      = type / catalog identity
  INSTANCE   = this specimen (keep-with rules)

LIFECYCLE (closed loop > hoarding):
  ACQUIRE → SERVICE/CALIBRATE → SURPLUS? → DECIDE → RELEASE (re-home w/ provenance)

RULES:
  canon simple; evidence layered; unknown stays unknown
  medium honors object; quiet by default; no dashboards
