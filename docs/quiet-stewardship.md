This diagram is a dense orientation map for how the archive is maintained:
- canonical records stay simple
- evidence is layered + attributed
- facts / unknowns / notes stay separate
- collection ≠ asset ≠ instance
- lifecycle completes (release / re-home allowed)
- quiet by default (no dashboards)
